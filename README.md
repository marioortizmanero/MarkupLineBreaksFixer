# Reddit Line Breaks Fixer

This is a simple program that automatically converts:

    Roses are red
    Violets are blue

**Output:**

*Roses are red
    Violets are blue*

to

    Roses are red

    Violets are blue

**Output 1:**

*Roses are red*

*Violets are blue*

so you can use it on pages like Reddit, StackOverflow, Github... where you need a double line break to make a new paragraph OR with the alternate method, which consists on adding two spaces (  ) before a single line break to make the distance smaller:

    Roses are red  //<---Double space here
    Violets are blue

**Output 2:**

*Roses are red*  
*Violets are blue*
